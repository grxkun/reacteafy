Connect to an Ethereum Node:
Replace 'http://localhost:8545' with the URL of your Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Ganache, or a local node).
You can also use providers like MetaMask or WalletConnect.
Now you have a basic setup for interacting with Ethereum using Web3.js in Gitpod! Feel free to build upon this foundation for your Ethereum-powered applications. 
Installation: [npm i reacteafy-app]
